        Sonified Simulated QPO Lightcurves
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Simulated Lightcurves
    </h2>
    <p>
        The lightcurves were produced using the Mind The Gaps Python package,
        and include a Bending Powerlaw red noise component and Lorentzian periodic component.
        They represent a year's worth of observations taken on a 3-day cadence,
        roughly approximating the LSST survey schedule.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Discrete Sonifications
    </h2>
    <p>
        For our trial run, we've represented each observation in the lightcurve as a discrete note,
        where the pitch represents the count rate of the detector.
        Higher count rates result in higher pitches.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Varying Instruments
    </h3>
    <p>
        We've tested a few different instruments,
        and if you've got any recommendations for more, or even specific SoundFonts, we'd welcome them!
        The piano and longer flute are probably the most pleasant-sounding,
        though whether or not they're useful is another question.

    <h3>
        Varying Tempo
    </h3>
    <p>
        We've tested a range of tempos as well.
        The 360BPM one sounds best to my ears, but again that's probably not helpful.
        There's likely a strong link between instrument and appropriate tempo,
        but these examples just use the flute and piano from earlier.
    </p>

        <li>

    <h2>
        Continuous Sonification
    </h2>
    <p>
        We've also tried out representing the sound as a continuous tone, shifting in pitch,
        with linear interpolation between the values at observations.
        It just uses a triangle wave synth, as used in the Strauss examples.
    </p>
    <audio controls><source src="static/audio/synth_continuous.aac" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <p>
        To my ears, this sounds fairly unpleasant, but I'm not sure if that means it's not useful.
        We've explored trying to get pitch-shifted SoundFonts in,
        but that seems to be a bit more difficult.
